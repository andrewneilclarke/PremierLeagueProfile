This is a practice project which extracts premier league data from an api, stores it and also makes instsances of the premier league teams using real data. 

1. First extract the football data from the api by running get_api_data. (API keys will need to be provided for this).

2. Run football.py. This will store the data in JSON files and into the variables.

3. Run team.py. This takes the data stored in the variables and assigns them to the class model. A for-loop then makes 20 team instances and populates their attributes with the downloaded data. The class also creates additional attributes based on the data such as defence and attack ratings.
